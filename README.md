# CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR UDACITY MACHINE LEARNING NANODEGREE 
This is deep learning project to train a model using tensorflow for identification of digits in SVHN dataset.  

## SOFTWARES
tensorflow, hdf5

## FILES
Project report is provided in Report.pdf.  
First run 1_Data_Wrangling.ipynb for data downloading and preprocessing the images and dump it as mutliple pickle files.  
Run 2_Model_CNN.ipynb for creating neural network model and training it.
